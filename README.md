It should be noted that `apriori.py` was written in `Python 3.5.3`. To run the program, you can specify minimum support with `-s support_number`, `-c confidence_number`, both of the previous, or neither of the previous. Here are examples of how parameters should be used:

- `python apriori.py`
- `python apriori.py -s .5`
- `python apriori.py -c .9`
- `python apriori.py -s .5 -c .9`
- `python apriori.py -c .9 -s .5 `

**Assignment Outline**:

Implement the apriori algorithm to determine the frequent sets in a dataset and then generate the association rules along with their support and confidence. Inputs to your program must include minimums for support and confidence.

Plot the runtime of your algorithm and the number of rules generated as a function of
    “minimum support”.

Use the same data set to derive association rules in Weka and compare them to those
    derived from your program.

If you have a dataset from the domain of your project, you are free to use it. Use any
    dataset from Weka datasets otherwise.

**Deliverables**:

Hand in a report along with the listing of your program, the output generated from the run of the test file on Canvas. Make sure that you have uploaded a signed copy of the Contributions form.

**TODO's**:

    -- Generate the association rules along with their support and confidence.
        ----> don't currently calculate support... not sure what they want support for
        ----> the confidence for the top rules seem to be a bit off from Weka's
    -- Plot the runtime of your algorithm and the number of rules generated as a function of
       “minimum support.”
    -- Use the same data set to derive association rules in Weka and compare them to those
       derived from your program.
    -- Report for assignment


**Files**:

    - apriori.py: the main python file conaining all logic
    - example_output_weka.txt: a sample of the association rules generated by Weka

    Data Folder...
    - vote.arff: original voting dataset
    - vote.csv: same as vote.arff but in csv form
    - vote-sample.csv: a subset of vote.csv containing only 50 rows. 
      This file is just used for testing purposes to make sure things
      are working before using the full dataset
    - altered-vote.csv: the same as vote-sample.csv but instead of 'y'
      or 'n', it contains elements more useful in apriori such as
      aid-to-nicaraguan-contras=y
    - encoded-vote.csv: the same as altered-vote.csv but uses integer
      encoding, which is more like what we saw in class when learning
      about transactions and itemsets. Should also improve efficiency of
      algorithm.
    - serialized-integer_to_data.json: a serialized representation of the
      integer to data dictionary used to decode the data
    - serialized-data_to_integer.json: a serialized representation of the
      data to integer dictionary used to encode the data
    - weka_rules_formatted.txt: top 10 weka association rules for the vote.csv file
