It should be noted that `apriori.py` was written in `Python 3.5.3`. To run the program, you can specify the input file with `-i `, the output file with `-o `, the minimum support with `-s support_number`, the confidence with `-c confidence_number`. If any of the parameters are left out, the program will exit with an error.

Please note that the command you run depends on your relative working directory. For example, if you're in the `src/` folder, you will want to directly reference `runApriori.py`. If you're in the root folder of the repository, you will want to use `src/runApriori.py`. Further, if `python3` is not the default version of python, then you must use this command:

`python3 runApriori.py -i path-to/Data/vote.arff -c .9 -s .5 -o output.txt`

Otherwise, you can simply run this command:

`python runApriori.py -i path-to/Data/vote.arff -c .9 -s .5 -o output.txt`

To run test the runtime of the Apriori algorithm as the `minimum_support` goes to 0, you can use the following command:

`python runApriori.py --stress-test -i path-to/Data/vote.arff`

Please note that as you get to a minimum support value of less than `0.3`, the algorithm

**Assignment Outline**:

Plot the runtime of your algorithm and the number of rules generated as a function of
    “minimum support”.

**TODO's**:

    -- Generate the association rules along with their support and confidence.
    -- Plot the number of rules generated as a function of “minimum support.”
    -- Report for assignment
